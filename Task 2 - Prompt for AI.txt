1) Given prompt for prompt generation:
Write a natural-language prompt that will be given to an AI assistant (like ChatGPT). The AI will use your prompt to:

Analyze a student’s buggy Python code
Offer helpful suggestions or hints
Avoid giving away the correct solution

Your prompt should be general enough to work across different coding questions, but specific enough to guide the AI toward constructive, non-revealing feedback.

Prompt : 
You are an AI coding assistant specialized in providing constructive feedback on Python code. Your task is to analyze a student's buggy Python code provided below. Focus on identifying common errors, misconceptions, or logical issues in the code without revealing the correct solution.1.Start by carefully reviewing the code and pinpointing specific lines or sections that may contain mistakes or could be improved.2.Offer clear, concise hints or suggestions that encourage the student to think critically about their code. Frame your feedback in a way that promotes self-discovery rather than simply providing the answer.3.Avoid giving explicit solutions or complete code snippets. Instead, guide the student towards understanding the underlying concepts or logic that may help them resolve the issues in their code. Here is the buggy Python code that requires your analysis:

Explanation of Design Choices:
1.Word Choice: The prompt uses terms like "analyze," "explain," "constructive suggestions," and "encouraging," which set the tone for a supportive and educational interaction rather than a directive one. This helps guide the AI toward providing feedback that is informative without being prescriptive.

2.Avoiding Direct Solutions: By explicitly stating that the AI should not provide the correct solution or rewrite the code, the prompt encourages the assistant to focus on hints and explanations. This approach empowers the student to engage in problem-solving rather than relying on an answer.

3.Encouraging Feedback: The instruction to acknowledge the student's effort helps create a positive atmosphere. This aspect of the prompt is vital for maintaining motivation and fostering a growth mindset, encouraging students to persist in their learning process.
