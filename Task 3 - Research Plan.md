### Research Plan

To evaluate open-source AI models for assessing student competence in Python, I would begin by surveying freely available LLMs and NLP tools such as Hugging Face’s Code Llama, StarCoder, or smaller educationally oriented models (e.g., OpenEdu initiatives). The evaluation would focus on their ability to analyze student-written Python code and then generate probing prompts rather than direct fixes. Suitability criteria include: (1) the model’s ability to detect logical or conceptual errors beyond syntax mistakes, (2) clarity and relevance of feedback phrasing, (3) flexibility in avoiding full solutions, and (4) transparency in reasoning. I would run test cases using common student misconceptions (e.g., misunderstanding loops, off-by-one errors, improper use of recursion) and observe whether the model produces feedback that encourages reflection rather than simply supplying code corrections.

Validation would involve designing a rubric for prompt quality: Are the generated questions open-ended, do they target underlying concepts, and do they balance specificity with student autonomy? For instance, given a buggy loop, does the model ask “What happens to the loop variable after each iteration?” instead of “Change line 5 to i += 1”? A suitable model for this high-level competence analysis must demonstrate not only accuracy in identifying the bug but also the pedagogical awareness to guide thinking. The trade-offs include accuracy versus interpretability (larger models may diagnose errors better but be harder to steer) and cost versus accessibility (smaller models like StarCoder base are lightweight but may miss nuanced misconceptions). I chose to highlight Code Llama as an initial candidate due to its strong code understanding, permissive license, and active support, but its limitation lies in occasionally defaulting to full code corrections rather than reflective questioning. Further fine-tuning or prompt engineering would be needed to align its output with educational goals.
